Create a text document and answer the following questions in it. Please put some real thought into answering these questions. You should have at least a few sentances for each answer, some will be more like a couple paragraphs. This is a time for you to reflect and share your thoughts with us, so donâ€™t worry too much about grammar or anything. We just want to hear from you!
